# java8features
A walk through of some new features in java 8. The main new fetures introduced in java 8 were lambdas and streams. I have created two test classes to demonstrate the two features. I have also used the new var keyword introduced in Java 10.
Run the classes LambdaTest and StreamTest to get a test result from the program.
